# Audio-Filter<br>
How to use the Audio-Filter script with attached example input.wav file. Before we get started you will need to have matplotlib for plotting the audio file and scipy for reading the audio file.<br>
Step 1) Run Audio_Filter.py<br>
Step 2) You should see a graph of the input.wav file. Look for the upper value number that you want to clip off and the lower values.<br> Exit out of the graph. <br>
Step 3) The script will ask a question for the upper value. For the example choose “20000” without quotes.<br>
Step 4) Next the script will ask for the lower value.  The example choose “5000” without quotes.<br>
Step 5) You should now see the graph with your modification. Exit out of the graph. And it creates the output.wav file.  And you are done. You have successfully upper and lower clipped an audio file. Now what do you think the example says…….<br>
